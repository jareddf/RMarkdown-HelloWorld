Hello World
-----------

This is my first R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting
syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. I'm still trying
to figure out how to *save* the **.md** file.

    a <- "hello world"
    a

    ## [1] "hello world"

Now with no Echo:

    ## [1] "hello world"
